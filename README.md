# RA17 Swerve
### What this does
Swerves.

### Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Build it
3. Deploy to the robot
4. Profit

### Logging
The robot writes telemetry to a log file. Finding it is left as an exercise 
to the reader.

### Configuration
Configuration is in the src/config.txt file. It should be deployed to the robot
in the file `/home/lvuser/config.txt`. You will need to disable and re-enable 
the robot for the configuration file to be reloaded and your changes to be
effective.

### Controls
I dunno. Try button mashing.

### Contributing
Fork this repository, make your changes and put in a pull request back here!
We love getting code for free.
